Project comparing CNN, ResNet50, and abridged Xception for binary malaria detection on >27,000 labeled microscope images from the NIH/TensorFlow dataset. Pipeline includes model-specific resizing, normalization to [0–1], augmentation (flips, brightness/contrast), and a 70/15/15 train/val/test split. Evaluation uses confusion matrices, precision/recall/F1, and ROC/PR curves; all models perform strongly, with ResNet50 marginally best (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.9929, PR-AUC ≈ 0.9925; example CM: TP 1992, TN 2003, FP 45, FN 94).
